# Hand-Gesture-Classification. (CNN Part 2)
Here, we will utilize the functions which we wrote last session and will try to build simple classification of hand gesture using the tensorflow model

#### Welcome to CNN Application! In this notebook, you will:
1. Implement helper functions that you will use when implementing a TensorFlow model.
2. Implement a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow.

### Dependencies:
1. Python 3.6
2. Numpy
3. tensorflow
4. Matplotlib
5. pydot
6. h5py
7. Scipy
8. Pillow(PIL)

### Step by Step Implementation of Hand Gesture Classification:
- [x] Install all the latest dependencies.
- [x] Clone the repository in your local system.
- [x] Make sure all folders are in same location
- [x] Open any python3.6 IDE and execute HandGestureRecognitionCNN.py
- [x] Visualize the results.

**The Repository also has notebook(.ipynb) file, which has detailed explnation of
project and also implmentation steps, do check it out once**
